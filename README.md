# COTORON | Code Toronto

The purpose of this repo is to create a website to showcase the next 10 projects (one per month). Yes, like a monthly hackathon. The idea is that we (and whomever wants to join) work together on a single project per month. We haven't decided on the projects yet and currently we don't have a theme. We could pick from the following list to create the 10 projects:

- internally
- previous projects (outside the 10 months)
- from some other list
- other ideas?

## Plan

- decide on a project
- discuss the MVP üèÅ
- code
- release
  - keep it under 1 month
    - first day of the month to last
- repeat ‚ôª

## Tech stack

- JavaScript
  - Node
  - React
  - Express
- Docker

## Rules | ever growing

- do not spend too much time on the project name
  - what is too much time? 1 hr?

## Miscellaneous

- [ ] decide if we want to use a wiki
- [ ] master branch flow
- [ ] release schedule
- [ ] versioning
  - [ ] SemVer MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
  - [ ] CalVer YYYY.MINOR.MICRO
