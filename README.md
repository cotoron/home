# COTORON | Code Toronto

The purpose of this repo is to create a website to showcase the next 10 projects (one per month). Yes, like a monthly hackathon. The idea is that we (and whomever wants to join) work together on a single project per month. We haven't decided on the projects yet and currently we don't have a theme. We could pick from the following list to create the 10 projects:

- internally
- previous projects (outside the 10 months)
- from some other list
- other ideas?
